	<!--
    The PokemonCard component should display the Pokemon image.
  -->

	<!--
    Below the image, there should be the Pokemon ID and the Pokemon Name.

    Bonus: Pokemon which are not caught, should have a name with the value of `"???"` and their
		image should be masked with the globally available `.masked` CSS class.
  -->

	<!--
    Clicking anywhere on the PokemonCard should link the user to `pokemon/:id` route.

    Bonus: Ensure that only "Caught Pokemon" are clickable and link to their `pokemon/:id` route (Pokedex entry).
